# Headless ESP32 Setup

## Setting up the ESP32 for a headless MQTT connection

- Exit back to your Pi's terminal by pressing CTRL+X then type exit.
- Download [mqtt_publish.py](https://github.com/jordharr/CREM/blob/main/ESP32/mqtt_publish.py) from the CREM GitHub repo.
- Modify the mqtt_publish.py file's below details
  - Wifi SSID & Password to your network's details
  - The topic that you want to set of your sensor
  - The server IP address of your raspberry pi (I have set it up using the default hostname of a raspberry pi)
  - The GPIO pin your sensor is connected to
- ```rshell --buffer-size=30 -p /dev/ttyUSB0``` into your ESP32 from your Pi.
- copy the file to the ESP32 by typing ``` cp mqtt_publish.py /pyboard ```
- type ``` repl ``` to get to the MicroPython interface
- enter ``` import mqtt_publish ``` and you should get an output similar to below
```
