# Processing the MQTT data

- Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi and enter the below to install the paho MQTT client & mariaDB connector.
```
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt
sudo pip3 install mariadb
```
- Download [rpi-mqtt.py](https://github.com/jordharr/CREM/blob/main/RPi/rpi-mqtt.py) from the CREM github repo.
- Modify this to use the database details you created in the previous step and add your sensor names to the sensors array.
- Run the file using ``` python3 rpi-mqtt.py ```
- This will start to pull data from the temperature sensor via MQTT and insert the data into your MySQL database.
