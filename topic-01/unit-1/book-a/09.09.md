# True Headless Setup

## Setting the script to run on boot

- Once you are happy that the script works, rename the mqtt_publish.py to boot.py on your desktop and run the below to copy it to the ESP32
```
cp boot.py /pyboard
```

On next boot, the script will run instantly and the ESP32 will be in headless mode.
